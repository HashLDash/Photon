# Please, consider using the following when contributing

- Variables, functions should use camel case, starting with lower-case
- Classes should be pascal case, starting with upper-case
- Global variables should be all upper-case

# Naming conventions

Please use short, but descriptive function names.
Example:

- Prefer programInstalled instead of programIsInstalled, or programAvailableInPath

# Functions and method explanations

- Please use docstrings to explain what is the function or method doing
- Use comments to explain a specific line

# Coding Style

Please avoid defining very specific functions when a general form is available.

Example:

- If we have a programInstalled function, avoid writing a gccIsInstalled. Use programInstalled instead.
