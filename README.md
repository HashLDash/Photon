# Wlang

Lightning fast and portable programming language!

# What is Wlang?

Wlang is a programming language aimed at filling the gaps of the Python language with respect to performance and portability. I love Python, but I cannot use it anywhere I want because it is not a supported language of the platform, lacks performance or is very cumbersome to actually package it or deploy it.
Wlang applications can run in any platform. Some examples are: Windows, Linux, MacOS, BSD, Android, IOs, RaspberryPi, HTML5, Xbox, Playstation, etc.

# I want to see it!

Devlog is available [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Seu5q_hc6go&list=PL89TmjrkwpOfteQJRptqmK-y8pr6uJdlc).
I also uploaded a video on my portuguese channel comparing it to Python and C, check it out [here](https://youtu.be/_8xtTyCTPXI).

# ALPHA Stage

Wlang is currently in alpha and not available to the general public yet. Launching a language while it is in development is not a good idea at the moment because I can't focus on its development and bug track.
If you like this project and want to contribute, please consider donating or subscribing to my youtube [channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChE5M9BAsdtlllOpfhIu8Tw), where I'll post a dev log of this language ([devlog](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Seu5q_hc6go&list=PL89TmjrkwpOfteQJRptqmK-y8pr6uJdlc)).
Also, join the discussion here on github about the future and your thoughts on the language!
