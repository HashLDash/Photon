# FOR iteration structure
# This loop will go from 0 to 4, and at each iteration the variable `i` will be incremented from 1 in 1.
for i in 0..5:
    print(i)

# Separate output with a new line
print()

# WHILE iteration structure
# The `i` variable that was previously defined in the FOR loop will now be decremented by 1 in 1 within the WHILE loop.
while i >= 0:
    print(i)
    i = i - 1
